THE PACK
The standard 52-card pack is used. Some cards will be dealt and the rest will form the stock pile.

OBJECT OF THE GAME
The goal is to win the most "books" of cards. A book is any four of a kind, such as four kings, four aces, and so on.

RANK OF CARDS
The cards rank from ace (high) to two (low). The suits are not important, only the card numbers are relevant, such as
two 3s, two 10s, and so on.

THE DEAL
Any player deals one card face up to each player. The player with the lowest card is the dealer. The dealer shuffles 
the cards, and the player to the right cuts them.The dealer completes the cut and deals the cards clockwise one at a 
time, face down, beginning with the player to the left. If two or three people are playing, each player receives seven 
cards. If four or five people are playing, each receives five cards. The remainder of the pack is placed face down on 
the table to form the stock.

THE PLAY
The player to the left of the dealer looks directly at any opponent and says, for example, "Give me your kings," 
usually addressing the opponent by name and specifying the rank that they want, from ace down to two. The player who 
is "fishing â€œmust have at least one card of the rank that was asked for in their hand. The player who is addressed must 
hand over all the cards requested. If the player has none, they say, "Go fish!" and the player who made the request 
draws the top card of the stock and places it in their hand. If a player gets one or more cards of the named rank that 
was asked for, they are entitled to ask the same or another player for a card. The player can ask for the same card or 
a different one. So long as the player succeeds in getting cards (makes a catch), their turn continues. When a player 
makes a catch, they must reveal the card so that the catch is verified. If a player gets the fourth card of a book, 
the player shows all four cards, places them on the table face up in front of everyone, and plays again.
If the player goes fishing without "making a catch" (does not receive a card he asked for), the turn passes to the left.
The game ends when all thirteen books have been won. The winner is the player with the most books. During the game, if 
a player is left without cards, they may (when it's their turn to play), draw from the stock and then ask for cards of 
that rank. If there are no cards left in the stock, they are out of the game.\n""")
